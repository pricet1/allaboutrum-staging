    "text": "Talk: Spatial Data and Mapping in R — speaker Maryna Shedzko\nDo you have an urge to know where?\nDiscover how to bring your data to life through mapping! This talk introduces the basics of spatial data and how to create stunning maps in R. Using the beloved ggplot2, tmap, and the powerful sf package, we’ll explore visualizing vector and raster data, creating thematic maps, and customizing them. Whether you;re new to spatial data or looking to enhance your data visualization skills, this session will guide you through the essentials of mapping in R.\nMaryna is a Research Software Engineer with a background in GIS and Biogeography. During her studies, she specialized in disease distribution, particularly using R for modelling and spatial analysis."

He has recently developed an R package for validating and updating clinical prediction models, predRupdate.\nTalk 2: Using the cosinor2 Package for R — speaker Augustin Mutak, Freie Universität Berlin\nAbstract: In this talk, attendees will learn about the cosinor model, which allows researchers to fit sinusoidal curves to detect periodicity, about different variants and extensions of the cosinor model and they will be given an overview of the package development. For every specific cosinor method mentioned in the talk, users will also be shown how to perform the corresponding analysis in R using the cosinor2 package.\nBio: Augustin Mutak is a Ph.D. student and a research assistant at Freie Universität Berlin, where he works on development of psychometric models for response times. Prior to that, he graduated psychology in Zagreb and researched fluctuations of mood, for the purpose of which he developed the cosinor2 package for R."
