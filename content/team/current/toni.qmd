<!-- Current team member -->

Toni is a Research Software Engineer at UoM with a passion for R, which she
first encountered whilst developing code for her PhD research in the
[Centre for Multilevel Modelling](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm). This sparked a
deep appreciation for R's power both as a functional programming language and
for statistical analysis (she also has a great fondness for ggplot2). Toni's
special interests are reproducible research & reporting, data visualisation and
software quality.
