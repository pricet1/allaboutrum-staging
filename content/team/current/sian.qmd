<!-- Current team member -->

I am a post-doctoral research associate in medical statistics at The University
of Manchester, working on a project developing a clinical prediction algorithm
for predicting risk of relapse in psychosis. I have been using R for around 6
years and particularly like the tidyverse and creating fun visualisations with
ggplot2.
