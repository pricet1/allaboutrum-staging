In this month’s meeting with speakers Rowan Green and Lucy Njoki Njuki we have two introductory talks on constructing tables followed by a small group discussion to share tips, tricks and best practices for making publication ready tables.

**Chair** Kamilla Kopec-Harding

**Talk 1** *Getting Things Done with gt table*, speaker **Rowan Green**

**Talk 2** *User-defined Functions to Create Summary Tables*, speaker **Lucy Njoki Njuki**

In environments like Microsoft Azure that do not support the default viewer mode, utilising tabulation packages like gtsummary becomes impractical. In this example, I will demonstrate the use of user-defined functions to summarise data in such environments, using knitr::kable() to beautify the resulting tables.
