Attention **R beginners**:
 
Tired of copy pasting blocks of code? Found yourself fixing the same bug in five
different places? Want to test many variations of your script? Generate multiple
similar plots?
 
Write R functions! They will make your R code more concise, easier to read,
debug, and maintain.

We'll have two short sessions:

**Talk 1**: *Introduction to Functions* &#8212; speaker **Martin Herrerias**

Martin will discuss basic function syntax, arguments, and environments.

**Talk 2**: *Generating Plots with Functions* &#8212; speaker **Sian Bladon**

Sian will give a brief introduction to ggplot2 and talk about using the map
function from purrr to automate creating multiple plots.
