Our regular TidyTuesday Data Visualization Club (on a Thursday!)

**Online Meeting**: [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a7067cf1044b243a4a548d19ef38dd4ca%40thread.tacv2/1698325355330?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c152cb07-614e-4abb-818a-f035cfa91a77%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221cfcabd8-8d24-43df-b813-0e99efdb530e%22%7d)  
*The Microsoft Teams chat is only available for members of the University of Manchester, if you want to get in touch write us an email at r-user-group@manchester.ac.uk*

The November meeting of the TidyTuesday meeting will be on Thursday 16th November from 1-3pm. We will confirm a room nearer the time but joining online will also be an option!

The dataset we will be using is here, if you want to make something in advance then that would be great, otherwise we could use the first hour to have a go then share.
